Additional tools utilizing the [Keras](https://keras.io) deep learning library,
available through [happy-tools-keras]([happy-tools](https://github.com/wairas/happy-tools-keras)):

* [happy-keras-pixel-regression-build](happy-keras-pixel-regression-build.md) - evaluate a Keras-based pixel regression model
* [happy-keras-segmentation-build](happy-keras-segmentation-build.md) - builds a Keras-based pixel segmentation model
* [happy-keras-unsupervised-build](happy-keras-unsupervised-build.md) - builds a Keras-based pixel segmentation model

These tools are available from the Python virtual environment that they were
installed. E.g., when following the installation instructions on this website,
the tools would be located in the following directory in the user's home folder:

```bash
