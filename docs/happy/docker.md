To make it easier to use the libraries (and avoid any hassle with installing 
libraries and required dependencies), we also make them available as 
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images:

* [happy-tools](https://hub.docker.com/r/waikatohappy/happy-tools)
* [happy-tools-keras](https://hub.docker.com/r/waikatohappy/happy-tools-keras)

If you are not familiar with Docker, please feel free to have a look at
the [Docker for Data Scientists](https://www.data-mining.co.nz/docker-for-data-scientists/)
introduction.
